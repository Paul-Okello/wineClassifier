# wineClassifier 🍷 🍷 🍷 
A simple program to tech my computer how to classify good and mediocre wine. 🍷🍷🍷🍷

I found some wine quality data online from the UCI machine learning data repository. In the dataset, there were approximately 5000 variations of white wine, with features such as citric acid levels, pH, alcohol, acidity, density, and so on. There was also a quality measure between 0 and 10.

I cleaned this data in python and then fed it to four different classifiers, using 80% of my data for training and 20% for testing. The four classifiers that I used were k nearest neighbors classifier, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, and stochastic gradient descent classifier.
